# 3D Lidar scanner

Lidars (LIgh Detection And Ranging) measure distances by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflection with a sensor.

This repository contains the source files to build it:
* Mechanical: STL files for 3D-printing, linkages bending patterns and SolidWorks source files,
* Electronics: circuit diagram,
* Arduino code: the Arduino project for the micro-controller,
* Processing code: the LidarViewer Processing sketch.
